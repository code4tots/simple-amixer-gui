I didn't like how alsamixergui interface is so complicated.
On my machine, even the master volume has two bars, one each for left
and right. Usually I just want to make system volume bigger or smaller.

This is just simple volume controller (uses amixer), with gui using
Tkinter. You can also control volume with mouse wheel.

I have not bothered to make this a background program, because I just use openbox without a taskbar.

Seems to work with both Python 2 and 3 on my machine.
